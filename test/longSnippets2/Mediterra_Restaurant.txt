risotto had tiny canned shrimp, was not tasty and came with clams in the shell, not mentioned on the menu or
salmon special was not nearly worth the price, but it was presented well.  will wait a few more years for
calamari $13, sangiovese $9, garlic fries and some other tappas. they have a very nice selection of foods allowing you to

calamari was also pleasing in both taste and sight. i especially liked the yellow sauce (waiter told me it was made
