risotto with seafood. i did see quite a few people saying
ortolana pizza did not have enough of anything on it. the
risotto with shrimp was by far my favorite dish on the
polenta and escarole.  not cheap, but not too much either.
margherita and the campione (mushroom, pancetta, smoked mozzarella, tomato). 
campione (mushroom, pancetta, smoked mozzarella, tomato). 
salmon is consistently excellent; it comes with braised lentils, wilted spinach,
risotto is also quite good.
margherita is good too. good salads.
campione because 1) the description says pancetta. i watch food network
ortolana barely had any veggies on it, and the cheese was
napoli at the trianon: not to thin and not to thick,
polenta was less crispy-fried than i'd been led to believe, closer
salmon and a cream sauce which he said was tasty. 
octopus dish.  it's delightful.  
calamari to be the best he'd ever eaten.
polenta sticks, fried pizza, other fried things between $1-3. the arancini
margherita pizza (~8" diameter). homemade tomato sauce, drizzles of olive oil,
risotto are still very good and the overall quality of the
filetto pizza was dry, with little cherry tomatoes rolling off every
calamari too!
