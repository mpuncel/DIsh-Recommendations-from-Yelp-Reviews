chicken marsala - which for me, i always did not like -
crab pasta dish i enjoy, but other then that its average.
grilled shrimp wrapped in prosciutto. none of the dishes are particularly creative,
crab dish for dinner and it was amazing. i don't think
hazelnut pesto and it was excellent! full of fresh vegetables, a hint
shrimp carbonara was incredibly heavy.  like, wow, there is a lot
carpaccio (i'm glad that they are one of the few places
flank steak (w/ salsa & fries) and ended with the millionaire pie
crab meat, mushrooms and bacon.  he thoroughly enjoyed that and
fettuccine every time. now, i swing between the pasta salad (a
pasta salad (a green salad with noodles, chicken, bacon and tasty dressing)
chicken marsala and his meal came with the same veggies and potatoes
grilled shrimp as an appetizer.  it came with 6 shrimp, good
chicken marsala which was yummy and perfectly cooked. my server, sam, was
stella's insalate ($5.45) was full of flavor from its toasted walnuts to
crab with seafood pasta called the crap. the lemon linguine also
fettuccine alfredo dish can't be beat. they have a pretty good
spaghetti marinara and the cheese lasagna and i would recommend both.
