polipo - grilled octopus served with marinated onions and potatoes. it's a simple
gnocchi (very light and fluffy-excellent)
caprese salad was two slices of tomatoes with one mozzarella slice and a
agnolotti - incredible, the braised beef and cheese mix melted in your mouth,
zuppa di mare (seafood in tomato saffron broth), one had scallops with endive and risotto,
pappardelle with duck & mushroom ragu... so friggin good!
caprese salad was indeed wonderful.  however, i had the duck served over
affettati e formaggi (sliced meats and cheeses) - i've never had italian bacon before and
ossobuco (veal). both were delicious and highly recommended. my boyfriend said that it

prosciutto was, of course, fantastic, but i was also pleased with the incredibly

caprese salad for appetizer. also highly recommend the suckling pig, sauce less lasagna
caprese salad i had was yummy and classic.  for dessert we ordered
caprese salad.  three slices of ruby red heirloom tomatoes, one nice-sized piece
zuppa di mare was so good, i dreamed of a pool filled with it and
bruschetta was very good, and so was the cheese cake recommended by our
agnolotti - butter fried sage leaves.  these unbelievably tasty morsels were quietly
gnocchi is some of the best i have had
agnolotti and an entree of the penne alla carbonara which were both exceptional.
penne alla carbonara which were both exceptional. i will be dreaming of my
linguine and lobster and shrimp was excellent as was the veal scallopine, thin
prosciutto to garnish.  i found it overly vinegary with little to balance
insalata verde is a bright tasting green salad full of green olives, fresh herbs
gnocchi malfatti is nothing short of spectacular. petite impossibly light dumplings covered in
bistecca alla pizzaiola and were overwhelmed. the fried potatoes and the steak rivaled each other
cesare barbera with the meal - good and relatively reasonable price-wise. 
caprese as a shared app, which was sparing with the very tasty mozzarella.
bruschetta which sounded great but tuns out the tomatoes are smoked -yck to

prosciutto di parma...all delicious and fresh. after that, for entrees we had the
prosciutto to the dish. can't wait to go back! the service, food and
spaghetti casalinga without the veal meatballs.  so essentially, i ordered spaghetti with crushed

agnolotti which were very good and i also had a delmonico steak with
