linguine fradiavolo
linguine was very flavorful. the seafood that came with it was fresh and
ravioli dish that i got, agnolotti di scampi allo zafferano. it was rich,
gnocchi and it was perfect.  the burratta was perfectly gooey and the
gnocchi had a great but not an overpowering flavor.  my boyfriend and
soup of the day was tasty, and the main dish was unreal! the
gelato was served with cocoa and hazelnuts and then one shot of espresso
bruschetta ai funghi trifolati, which were the mushrooms. 
mussels and clams just weren't cutting it.

caprese salad. mozzarella was perfect! creamy and flavorful. they serve capers with the
caprese which was a little weird.
soup is more of a babyfood consistency but with the added croutons, it
caprese salad fan. i was surprised by their caprese for three reasons; lack of
caprese for three reasons; lack of vinegar of any kind, addition of capers,
caprese and more of a buona tavola salad.

linguine fradiavolo.  another concern was that while we could have asked, our
gelato is divine! opt for the one topped with fresh seasonal fruit. it's
gelato daily at the store. it's topped with a mildly sweet syrup. the
insalata bufala were great.  a fun and comprehensive wine list, with some welcome
ravioli they give you! but i can't stop ordering it for some reason!
penne arrabiatta and had them add some sausages and extra cheese.  wow,
soup - i asked for a small, they brought me a large and
fish dinner and was unimpressed.  that's okay because i gave him most
gnocchi which sounded cool, but the sauce was so overpowering, you couldn't tell
