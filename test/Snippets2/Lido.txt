spaghetti with veal meatballs (i'm telling you, they're delicious) and it was great.

tiramisu is outstanding.  can't wait to see the new fall menu!
burrata and poached eggs. mmmmm... everything, everything is delicious.
farmstead cheeses as dessert!

tilapia outstanding, two filets on a rich bed of lentils, mirepoix and pancetta
burrata may, perhaps, change your life. take note: burrata. 
gnocchi ("no bacon, k?", the annoying vegetarian asks) is a kiss from venice.
beet salad which was very good. it tasted fresh and the goat cheese and

mussels to start-all were great. the short ribs were also delicious, as was
spaghetti with veal meatballs.  all around a delicious meal, we will definitely

salmon is good, and pineapple upside cake very tasty. not complains about the
