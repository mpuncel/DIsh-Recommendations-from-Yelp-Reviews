gnocchi (very light and fluffy-excellent)
caprese salad was two slices of tomatoes with one mozzarella slice and a
calamari appetizer is delish as well and much more substantial. 
agnolotti - incredible, the braised beef and cheese mix melted in your mouth,
zuppa di mare (seafood in tomato saffron broth), one had scallops with endive and risotto,
pappardelle with duck & mushroom ragu... so friggin good!
caprese salad was indeed wonderful.  however, i had the duck served over
calamari & shrimp -- very fishy smell when it first arrived. i think
calamari & shrimp were both grilled, and drizzled with a balsamic sauce &
affettati e formaggi (sliced meats and cheeses) - i've never had italian bacon before and
ossobuco (veal). both were delicious and highly recommended. my boyfriend said that it

calamari is tasty, with an interesting sauce - kind of thick, creamy, and
pesce del giorno.  mom had the risotto and calamari--nice and creamy and
calamari was cooked to perfection.  my father got the appetizer portion of
caprese salad for appetizer. also highly recommend the suckling pig, sauce less lasagna

farfalle was incredible! the flavors however of the dish were mediocre at best
bruschetta with burrata cheese and port apple puree - it was good but
bruschetta is supposed to be.  i also tried the sicilian fried shrimp
gnocchi with parmigiano cream
gnocchi was also very soft and delicate and each bite was creamy and
pappardelle with duck and mushrooms.  the ossobucco is also outstanding.
