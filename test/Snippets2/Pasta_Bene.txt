bruschetta (awesome)
rustica (awesome)
salmon alfredo dish. after trying all those dishes i was never disappointed. their
tortellini primavera ($7.95) is a nice light pasta with a creamy tomato sauce. it
salmon is the most expensive dish at $10.95, but it's not bad of
calamari is fried very well, next time i'll ask them to make it
crab cakes as an appetizer and the marco polo and beef lasagna as our
beef lasagna as our entree. the crab cake was so good. probably one of
crab cakes on sliced napa cabage salad with ranch sauce. the salad was really
beef lasagna and i had the marco polo. i'd  have to say that
beef lasagna is the best lasagna hands down. there's no way you can get
chicken marsala and gnocchi sausage...but before we dive into the goodness of food, let
chicken breast and mushroom and fettuccini. the chicken isn't dry and goes well with
gnocchi sausage and the gamberetto. don't forget to try the tiramisu!
cheesecake & tiramisu is love!!!! especially the tiramisu! they are both only 3

melanzane pasta again.
marco pollo and the calamari is also good for a beginning appetizer. 
calamari is also good for a beginning appetizer. 
garlic bread (or both) every time and it's not like ordering a whole other
chicken marsala and the spaghetti & meatballs. the chicken marsala is wonderfully light and
chicken marsala is wonderfully light and perfect for someone who doesn't like creamy pastas.
tiramisu is also pretty good, but i've had better.
bruschetta is great as is the garlic bread! i had the chicken marsala,
gorgonzola salad and my husband had the soup and we loved both. 
bruschetta and call that my lunch next time i come. and yes there
calamari until they give that batter recipe some more flavor. other than that,
salmon is nearly identical to the $27 salmon pesto i ordered at trattoria
salmon pesto i ordered at trattoria la siciliana. guess what? the salmon at
salmon at pasta bene is only $10.95! soooo ridiculously good.
salmon -  highly recommended
salmon fillet
tiramisu cake on my birthday.  
salmon or chicken picatta. i also recall liking their tiramisu a lot. obviously

tiramisu with a friend who lives nearby.  the second night we actually
tiramisu again!).  i wasn't sure what to order.  my friends love
beef lasagna 6.95(5.95 during lunch special 11am-3pm)
eggplant parmigiana 6.95
tiramisu for dessert.  it was so creamy and delicious.  the prices
bruschetta here is only a couple of bucks, and it is actually delicious.
carciofi e pollo is where it's at. yum. and their tiramisu (which, by the way,
tiramisu (which, by the way, is only $3+tax!) = heaven in your mouth.
garlic fries were tasty. they weren't drenched in oil like i others i had
chicken breast & mushroom in alfredo sauce - i usually don't get this since
garlic bread and bruschetta, and considering how inexpensive they were, i wasn't expecting much
garlic bread was on foccacia, which would've been fine, except it was stale and
bruschetta came with two toasted pieces of bread topped with just too much
chicken parmigiana and i had the marco pollo: fettuccini with prosciutto, green peas &
chicken picatta which was pretty good.  i'd like to see some vegetables with
salmon - all were good, pretty comparable to what i'd expect from a
calamari & crab cakes as appetizers for the whole group. i ordered gnocchi
crab cakes as appetizers for the whole group. i ordered gnocchi sausage for my

crab cakes were both just ok. the calamari, which was fried light & crispy
gnocchi sausage was a big heaping bowl of heavy heartiness. & with the potato
chicken marsala also liked my dish more than his own, so i think that's
melanzane if you are cool with eggplants! even writing about it right now
calamari and a piece of tiramisu between 6 of us and finished everything.
tiramisu between 6 of us and finished everything. the restaurant looked aesthetically appealing,
carciofi e pollo and tortellini. the sauces weren't too heavy and were just the right
cheese ravioli today and was blown away - fresh house-made pasta and very flavorful
tiramisu blows every other italian restaurant away.  walk the few extra blocks
tiramisu is just so good.
chicken marsala and except for the pasta being a touch undercooked, it was satisfying.
carciofi e pollo and pasta bene, and both are delicious choices. the calamari is good
calamari is good and the tiramisu is sooo yummy (must try!). but back
tiramisu is sooo yummy (must try!). but back to the pasta--carciofi e pollo
beef lasagna - all were satisfactory. one thing is, their price seems a bit
cheese ravioli and the greek salad, both of which are excellent.
cheesecake are all great  as well!
penne bolognese (available for $5 during lunch)
chicken breast with a side salad. it was very good and tasty and the
bruschetta was like they took some bread from safeway, sprayed some butter on
cheese ravioli was fresh but left hungry wanting more
beef lasagna and cheese ravioli on separate occasions, and both times they were kind
cheese ravioli on separate occasions, and both times they were kind of bland. the
rustica (on the pastas) sooo good!!
bruschetta was topped with a ton of tomatoes which i really liked. the
tiramisu was in a world of it's own as it came with a
tiramisu here multiple times, but never sat down and ate the actual food.
gnocchi sausage on the suggestion from fellow yelper dmitriy s. it was freaking delicious.
tiramisu though, i feel like the food is just about the same standard
tiramisu is what is amazing.
penne bolognese was amazing! it was meaty, cheesy & tomato-y. it packed a punch,
calamari with garlic sauce like from cheesecake factory. what else do i need
cheesecake factory. what else do i need to say? xd
calamari which was perfectly done.  i do not always like fried calamari,
rustica which had sausage and eggplant.  both were great.  the eggplant
rustica pasta was also perfectly done.  the red sauce was a little
garlic bread tastes yucky, and you kicked us out at 9pm!!!). it's very fresh,
salmon pasta dish was like $10.50 or sometohing. we ordered...
calamari for an appetizer, i had the marco pollo and he had the
marco pollo and he had the chicken marsala.  we loved it, the food,
tiramisu  is pretty great too! very amiable staff
beef lasagna and it was really good. filled with beef, cheese and spinach, the
beef lasagna i had at pasta bene was my favorite, far and away, of
chicken marsala is my ultimate favorite because they give me a fat piece of
carciofi e pollo (linguini w/ chicken breast, artichoke hearts&veggies in oliveoil herb sauce), which he
melanzane to go and was offered a glass water as i waited by
chicken marsala with linguini, di casa salad and an iced tea. there were plenty
di casa salad and an iced tea. there were plenty of clean tables and
calamari but it is a bit too rubbery for me. the breading falls
tiramisu is heavenly.
crab cakes ($5.95) for appetizer - looks really dark on the exterior, but it's
cheesecake isn't the best in the world, but for this price, not only
chicken marsala and noticed how the mushrooms were drenched in wine previously, so the
tiramisu cake - layers of delicate combo between cake/chocolate/musse. absolutely delightful!
calamari and the fries were good. i wouldn't go the way to order
beef lasagna which was pretty cheap, i think it was 6.95? cheap eats +
garlic bread and i think i like it that way quite a bit. medium-heavy
crab cakes spongy or rock-hard due to poor execution. these were just right. not
bruschetta (1.95) and i absolutely love it. it's only two pieces of bread
melanzane which was probably the only thing that i didnt absolutely love. 
tiramisu for free one time because one of my friend's is a super
melanzane which has perfectly cooked eggplant in it.
tiramisu is the booommmmmmbbbbbbbbbbb. lol i have to order it when i come
salmon pesto fettucine. no wonder it was packed during dinnertime on a sunday.
garlic bread was pretty garlicky - they put a respectable amount of chopped up
rustica is hearty. 
tiramisu is so gooood and i don't care if they got it from
salmon and the gambertto. the prices were reasonable and comparable to gypsys. the
garlic fries were unimpressive and uninspired (stick to the ones at smart alec's). as
salmon which was decent. pasta with pesto sauce and a hunk of salmon.
salmon good have used a little more flavoring and the garlic bread was
garlic bread was well...not really garlic bread. it was just a regular hunk of
melanzane (fettuccini with roasted eggplant, sundried tomatoes & garlic in marinara sauce). i
garlic bread because i love garlic bread! the food took a bit long but
tiramisu next time.
bruschetta was good too! and service was friendly and accommodating.
tiramisu again. currently, i believe they have happy hour drinks all day ($3.50/glass
garlic bread the right way, and by "right" i mean good. crunchy on the
garlic bread was mouthwateringly delicious, along with the marinara dipping sauce that accompanied it.
penne bolognese is good, but nothing special, which can be said with some of
gnocchi sausage was not bad, but wasn't anything special. i guess its a toss
tiramisu to be more rich and creamy though.
bruschetta (2 pcs) and the spaghetti and meatballs. the bruschetta was excellent and
bruschetta was excellent and served on a garlic toast. the tomato mixture had
tiramisu was whatever... but it's okay because this is pasta bene...
salmon on top, but larger portions.
salmon pesta pasta. i got all 3 dishes to go. very fast 15
gamberetto which is fettucine with shrimp, bell pepper, and mushroom in a tomato

chicken breast , artichoke hearts, and assorted vegetables like carrots and zucchini in an
carciofi e pollo was basically a mix of linguini, chicken breast, and vegetables that could
cheese ravioli was just a double bummer because it was different from what was
gnocchi sausage and tropicana pizza! niiice
gnocchi sausage has good flavors, but the portion isn't that big.  chicken parmigiana
chicken parmigiana is decent as well.  i like the tiramisu that they have.
tiramisu that they have.  the service is always friendly and nice, but
gnocchi sausage was really good but last time i came i ordered the chicken
tiramisu to share and it was a nice finish to the meal. 
ice cream is amazing. they've achieved the perfect consistency of cream and liquid and
melanzane was delicious! beats gypsy's greasy oily-ness. the tiramisu had raspberry sauce on
tiramisu had raspberry sauce on the plate, and it was the perfect fluffiness
tiramisu was also pretty good, and a great deal for only $3. the
garlic bread thinking that the entrees wouldn't come with bread - but they did
garlic bread though)! we still managed to finish all of it though - because
cheese ravioli was really good - and even though the marinara sauce in it
melanzane bc it's basically spaghetti with eggplant and tomato sauce.  
tiramisu if you still have space in your stomach since the portions here
bruschetta - two slices of toasted bread topped with olive oil, diced tomatoes
cheesecake is pretty good too. the panini and garlic fries are great for
garlic fries are great for lunch. the prices are very reasonable. they have a
garlic fries and a tropical themed large pizza. 
tiramisu next time.
crab cakes as our appetizer because many people mentioned it in their reviews. it
salmon dish and i ordered the chicken parmigiana. i guess i should've been
bruschetta and also tried the eggplant appetizer. all three were good! the pasta
bruschetta is a personal favorite. let me say, i don't even like tomatoes
garlic bread here was amazing. the pasta wasn't bad, the portions were just too
chicken parmigiana patty that was microwaved with a piece of cheese on top. it
bruschetta was also soggy by the time they brought it to us.
marco pollo and it was yummy in my tummy. no joke. i would recommend
salmon is a bit small and a bit too much pasta compared to
chicken breast needs some time to be fully and well cooked.  
gnocchi sausage was really good, especially for the price! i got a teeny bit
bruschetta topping is quite good, but the bread is hard and oily. the
garlic bread is similarly mediocre, though both prices are good. the pasta / entrees,
calamari appetizer and good salads. ok house wine. generous portions.  canned mushrooms
chicken marsala but fetticini was fresh.  pasta bene dish had fresh vegetables. 
bruschetta for only $2!  all of this and the bill was only
penne bolognese and it's pretty good, but slightly oily.
chicken picatta and the king salmon in the pasta department.  their pizza and
salmon in the pasta department.  their pizza and bruschetta is also delicious
bruschetta is also delicious and not to be overlooked.  the old couple
calamari for appetizers, then had some salads, pasta and pizza dishes, wine and
gnocchi sausage is soo good. i think i just fell in love.  it's
