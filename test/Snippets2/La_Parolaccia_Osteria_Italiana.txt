tagliatelle trilussa (tagliatelle, italian ham, peas, asparagus, pancetta, onions, garlic in a tomato sauce)
margherita style pizza, an arribiata pasta, some salad and brought our own wine.
gnocchi al gorgonzola was so good! the gnocchi was cooked perfectly, not too mushy and
barese pizza that we had for lunch the other time we dined there.
margherita pizza (safe) since this was my first experience here.  i'm very
positano pizza to share between 3 people and it was a very nice
focaccia completa to start "thin focaccia bread with arugala and prosciutto".  it was
tortellini pinturicchio with verdicchio di jesi, which was light and crisp. for dessert, i
tagliatelle trilussa and my husband ordered the lasagna. wow our food was delightful. my
napoletana with anchovies and olives. we also tried one with goat cheese, arugula
margherita it was, with flavorful sauce and cheese.
