i was debating between the baked red snapper with mango salsa and chicken pasta diabolo. with the recommendation from the chef and my liking for mango, i chose the red snapper.

penne pasta diabolo and the pecan crusted salmon were awesome! great place, but cash only.
salmon with polenta and the stuffed shrimp were very satisfying.
