pretty good. ordered the crispy pig ears and the grilled chicken panini. the chipotle aioli goes well with the pig ears. the panini was solid as well.
with the pig ears. the panini was solid as well. sadly didn't have any of the wines when i made my visit
got to enjoy the best mac and cheese ever made! it had perfectly cooked, tender, macaroni, was extra cheesy, topped with thinly sliced green onion and crumbled bacon.
like the place.  the roasted garlic pizza and the bacon & brie pizza (minus the bacon) were perfectly sized and baked to a thin, cheesy crisp.
when you order the pan-seared scallops and see that only a quarter of that delicate, small square bowl is filled with food.  we also got
a fan.
the pan-seared scallops with carrot puree is a must order!  it's delish!!!  we ordered the bacaro burger, artichoke hearts, chicken breast,
& brie pizza, garlic pizza, bone marrow and of course, the scallops!  the only other thing i would recommend is the bacon & brie pizza. 
it was dry...gross!  the chicken breast was kinda tough and dry even though it was drenched with lemon caper sauce.  the mac & cheese was

worth the 7 dollars (the polenta cakes), but i'm always for tryin things and making your own mistakes. 
cold dish was the roasted rainbow beets which is an assortment of different types of beets. this dish was good but the beets were a little too
$1. we also ordered the scallops which came in a puree sauce and white truffle oil. this dish was also good but only came with 2
greens. we also ordered the white pizza which came with bacon and scallions. 
probably wouldn't order it again.
cheese was alright, and the scallops were tender and sweet.  i could have had more of the scallops.
choice of tomatoes and basil, roasted garlic and balsamic, or a white bean concoction.  favorite.
a fantastic sauce.  yum.

it only comes with 2 scallops tho, so that made me a bit sad. the scallop was fresh & cooked to perfection.
really really well with the scallops + corn.  also went well with the lamb sliders (delicious btw).

artichokes and definitely do the bacaro burger with friend egg!!

for me were probably the polenta with eggplant, the artichokes, all the crostini, and the bread pudding for dessert.  however, everything we had was amazing.
balsamic - so yummy! tender chicken breast on the risotto parmesan cake in the caper sauce also recommended.  
sweet corn - my 2 scallops were cooked perfectly and sauteed in a light, tasty broth with sweet corn.  soooo good!
5 buck small plates...

bacaro burger w/egg = i just went to heaven.
