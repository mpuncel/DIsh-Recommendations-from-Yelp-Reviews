calamari FOODWORD - fabulous
calamari FOODWORD was not good. skip it. i ordered the
paella FOODWORD isn't a dish that chefs should alter but
crab cake FOODWORD entree that cost $30.  needless to say,
calamari FOODWORD and bruschetta for appetizers.  i then had
salmon FOODWORD and we shared tiramisu for desert.  outstanding!!!
octopus FOODWORD appetizer was great and i don't even like
octopus FOODWORD in general. i had the paella one night
paella FOODWORD one night and a filet special the previous
paella FOODWORD of course. the bread itself and olive oil
risotto FOODWORD had tiny canned shrimp, was not tasty and
salmon FOODWORD special was not nearly worth the price, but
calamari FOODWORD $13, sangiovese $9, garlic fries and some other
calamari FOODWORD hit just the right notes.  oricchiette, moroccan
paella FOODWORD - god awful - please don't touch it.
calamari FOODWORD appetizer... did not like the fish entrees... those
paella FOODWORD were probably the things that would stick out

paella FOODWORD which was great!! tons of large shrimp mussles
paella FOODWORD too!!) the rice was realllyyy good but if

octopus FOODWORD salad was bitter, the salad had too many
risotto FOODWORD is a bit unwarranted, don't you think? 
octopus FOODWORD is yummy, and smells tantalizingly like a summer
calamari FOODWORD was great, but the beet salad had large
salmon FOODWORD entree, which was fantastic though not as good
salmon FOODWORD itself was cooked into consideration... not the sauces
risotto FOODWORD and the skirt steak, cooked well. 
pork saltimbocca FOODWORD was so-so.
calamari FOODWORD was also pleasing in both taste and sight.
calamari FOODWORD from the nearby witherspoon grill more. the grilled
paella FOODWORD which was excellent. just the right size portion
greek salad FOODWORD made up of too much romaine, one cucumber,
mezze sampler FOODWORD that was utterly forgetable - baba ganoush, red
ricotta gnocchi FOODWORD was delicious - silky, light little pillows in
orecchiette FOODWORD dish was superb! with house made pork sausage,
octopus FOODWORD dishes.  both are very flavorful and fresh.
