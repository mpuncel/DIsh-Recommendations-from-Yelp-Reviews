calamari which was fried to tender and tasty perfection and it was served with a delicious green and equally delicious red
minestrone which she said was delicious. she actually pushed it away because she didn't want to get too full for her
linguine and the margherita pizza both of which they loved and looked and smelled delicious. i highly recommend this place for

orecchiette which was superb. at the end we had the tiramisu, which was good. 
calamari which everyone loved. 
cappellini which i thought was just ok. being vegetarian that was really the only option for me. it wasn't bad, but
ravioli and 2 lobster tails.
salmone alla griglia and my dad got the special of the day which was swordfish. they both really enjoyed their meals also.
ravioli with pancetta, leeks and potato slivers on top, a bleu cheese salad and something ridiculous for dessert like a tiramisu.

risotto i had had in a while. tutti mangia does serve up good food, but it is pricey compared to some
bruschetta to start, and to be honest, i didn't really like any of the three toppings. yes, there are three different
pappardelle was less impressive, the sauce didn't taste like boar-meat sauce that i am used to, it was almost more like
pappardelle noodle chunk with meat sauce.
pesce bianco which was roasted seabass and instead of the sliced redskins i had the goat cheese mashed potatoes, very interesting i
linguine and i thought the scallops were delightful! this place really does italian right...the only complaint i have is when he

risotto was perfectly creamy and decadent. i highly recommend tutti mangia for any holiday, valentine's day, or special occasion celebration!
insalata casa cuneo is a personal favorite. i tend to gravitate toward the steak, but have enjoyed a bite or two of pasta
