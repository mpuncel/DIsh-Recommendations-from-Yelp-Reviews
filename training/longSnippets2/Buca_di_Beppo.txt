pepperoni pizza!  they have an ice cream desert which is excellent also, good for a few people easily.
saltimbocca and small lasagna for three people and we were stuffed. leftovers were worth two lunches the next day.

saltimbocca wasn't anything special - chicken breasts topped w/proscuitto (but not necessarily adding any flavor), plain artichoke hearts, capers and lemon
lasagna or the saltimbocca. i'm not sure which one and my stomach can hold up to most food. nobody else in
fettuccine alfredo was bland also the bruschetta lacked salt, way under seasoned. service was great.

penne san remo is outstanding! my only complaint would be the cost of the garlic bread. it is way out of line compared
baked ziti i pulled a huge clump of hair out of the back of my throat making it my one and only
baked rigatoni and fettuccine supremo. 
tiramisu is kind of too alcohol tasting for my taste. it's a chain-you really can't go wrong.
spicy chicken rigatoni was nice too! the ginormous portions are out of control though
chicken marsala and apple gorgonzola salad. but the pastas and pizzas are also pretty good. the pizzas are a little oily for
bruschetta is also good.
penne basilica claims to have chicken a brocoli in it, it barely had any if that. small over cooked florets and tiny
bruschetta was  brutal the eggplant was tits.the portions are large.limoncello  all in all this place is one of my
spaghetti with meatballs is impressive, they sure don't skimp on the meat. the desserts are good (probably won't help you lose any weight).
pepperoni pizza (extra pepperoncini!) for the vegetarians, there is a really good veggie based pasta, but the name escapes me.

apple gorgonzola salad and the cheese pizza.  service is good, as long as you're not there on the weekend when it gets
cheesecake about half the size of my head!  so much for not eating mass quantities of bread!  overall, nice
pepperoni pizza, lasagna, bottle of chianti. gather favorite family & friends to share & you're certain to let the good times

chicken limone because we weren't super hungry that day and guess what?!  our waitress was so sweet and gave us a
linguine frutti di mare (shrimp, baby clams, mussels and calamari tossed with a spicy red clam sauce) on the house because she said another
tiramisu is pretty bomb.  when i offered to buy my best friend a cake for her birthday, she asked me
tiramisu from here instead xd.  
tiramisu was over powered with rum. 
veggie pizza and a salad. it was a little better this time, but definitely not worth its price. 
garlic bread at an italian place is a bit ridiculous to me. the cheese bread was another 10 bucks and there wasn't
spaghetti with meat sauce ( it has small  chunks of meat in the sauce) with great seasoning. remember it is family style at
margherita pizza.  more than enough food for the the three of us.  the food came out pretty quickly and
chopped antipasto salad was the best thing of the night.  note you have to ask for bread and water, as it will
garlic bread though, at $9.00/basket. 
garlic bread is a loaf and a half!!  lol
penne arrabbiata zesty. baked rigatoni comfort food. lasagna mmm... i'm full. go ahead and get yourself something. don't forget mozzarella garlic bread.

lasagna was a bit too dry for my taste, but their salads are to die for. probably one of the best
apple gorgonzola salad is tasty as well. most of their pasta dishes are decent...not great, but not bad. i look forward to coming
prosciutto stuffed chicken as well. i've had the frutti di mare and the marsala a bunch of times. all good. honestly, i haven't
tiramisu with an expressly coffee.
caesar salad and bread, and tiramisu. however, a bunch of my friends were treated to a hurry and leave attitude from the
tiramisu and got one cup and never saw our waitress dina again. some dark haired guy kept coming by getting our
saltimbocca is chicken breast dish that has sage, prosciutto, artichoke, capers, in a lemon sauce. i would order this instead of
