risotto with seafood. i did see quite a few
ortolana pizza did not have enough of anything on
risotto with shrimp was by far my favorite dish
polenta and escarole.  not cheap, but not too
margherita and the campione (mushroom, pancetta, smoked mozzarella, tomato).
campione (mushroom, pancetta, smoked mozzarella, tomato). 
salmon is consistently excellent; it comes with braised lentils,
risotto is also quite good.
margherita is good too. good salads.
campione because 1) the description says pancetta. i watch
ortolana barely had any veggies on it, and the
napoli at the trianon: not to thin and not
polenta was less crispy-fried than i'd been led to
salmon and a cream sauce which he said was
octopus dish.  it's delightful.  
calamari to be the best he'd ever eaten.
polenta sticks, fried pizza, other fried things between $1-3.
margherita pizza (~8" diameter). homemade tomato sauce, drizzles of
risotto are still very good and the overall quality
filetto pizza was dry, with little cherry tomatoes rolling
calamari too!
