calamari - fabulous
calamari was not good. skip it. i ordered the
paella isn't a dish that chefs should alter but
crab cake entree that cost $30.  needless to say,
calamari and bruschetta for appetizers.  i then had
salmon and we shared tiramisu for desert.  outstanding!!!
octopus appetizer was great and i don't even like
octopus in general. i had the paella one night
paella one night and a filet special the previous
paella of course. the bread itself and olive oil
risotto had tiny canned shrimp, was not tasty and
salmon special was not nearly worth the price, but
calamari $13, sangiovese $9, garlic fries and some other
calamari hit just the right notes.  oricchiette, moroccan
paella - god awful - please don't touch it.
calamari appetizer... did not like the fish entrees... those
paella were probably the things that would stick out
paella was about 24-28 per person and required two.
paella compared to places such as the common grill.
paella which was great!! tons of large shrimp mussles
paella too!!) the rice was realllyyy good but if
greek chicken and potatoes was delicious.  the woman next
octopus salad was bitter, the salad had too many
risotto is a bit unwarranted, don't you think? 
octopus is yummy, and smells tantalizingly like a summer
calamari was great, but the beet salad had large
salmon entree, which was fantastic though not as good
salmon itself was cooked into consideration... not the sauces
risotto and the skirt steak, cooked well. 
pork saltimbocca was so-so.
calamari was also pleasing in both taste and sight.
calamari from the nearby witherspoon grill more. the grilled
paella which was excellent. just the right size portion
greek salad made up of too much romaine, one cucumber,
mezze sampler that was utterly forgetable - baba ganoush, red
ricotta gnocchi was delicious - silky, light little pillows in
orecchiette dish was superb! with house made pork sausage,
octopus dishes.  both are very flavorful and fresh.
