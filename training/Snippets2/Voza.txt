stuffed shrimp with goat cheese and pesto was basically five warm cocktail shrimp with
rack of lamb (i had it medium-rare) was very good. i had it with the
baked red snapper with mango salsa and chicken pasta diabolo. with the recommendation from the chef and my
skirt steak and it tasted like a microwaved tv dinner. never again!!
spinach and artichoke dip by mistake, it might have been the best one, not something i
ceviche was awesome, and the potato gnocci, to die for. chicken penne pasta
pecan crusted salmon were awesome! great place, but cash only.
stuffed shrimp were very satisfying.
