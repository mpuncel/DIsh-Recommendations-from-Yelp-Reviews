orecchiette pasta special of something or other. it was sooooo rich! tasty, but
calamari which was fried to tender and tasty perfection and it was served
minestrone which she said was delicious. she actually pushed it away because she
linguine and the margherita pizza both of which they loved and looked and
cappellini at all costs. it's definitely not my type of pasta.
new york strip steak and wilted spinach. the steak was cooked to order (medium rare)
orecchiette which was superb. at the end we had the tiramisu, which was
calamari which everyone loved. 
cappellini which i thought was just ok. being vegetarian that was really the
ravioli and 2 lobster tails.
salmone alla griglia and my dad got the special of the day which was swordfish.
ravioli with pancetta, leeks and potato slivers on top, a bleu cheese salad
calamari were the best i've ever had!!
prosciutto e burrata (cheese).  i suppose if i had known what burrata cheese was,
filet mignon steak was buttery and delicious! i had a peppercorn crust on it.
osso buco which she thoroughly enjoyed, as she only shared a small bite!! 
pesce bianco - a fabulous combination of sea bass, mushrooms, and red skin potatoes
ravioli and i'm still craving for them....
calamari itself was uneventful, the aioli with it was good. bread was served
orecchiette and my girlfriend has had the tortellaci di zuca and a vegetarian
risotto i had had in a while. tutti mangia does serve up good
pappardelle was less impressive, the sauce didn't taste like boar-meat sauce that i
pappardelle noodle chunk with meat sauce.
pesce bianco which was roasted seabass and instead of the sliced redskins i had
linguine and i thought the scallops were delightful! this place really does italian
calamari that i highly recommend and the chitarra which consists of 
orecchiette :
carpaccio of prosciutto for $23..
linguine with yellow tomatoes.
filet mignon and it was spectacular. the wine reduction was excellent and the truffle
ravioli and it was fantastic!  my server, megan, really sold me on
calamari for an appetizer which turned out very filling. had their risotto for
risotto for my main course and it was very flavorful! everything was great
risotto was undercooked, as were the clams.  
calamari fritto was also very good, dipped in either the excellent mild marinara
osso buco was good but over salted, and the polenta served with it was
linguine special described as spicy and with scallops. i wouldn't describe it as
cappellini a la checca, caesar salad.....so delish. 
minestrone soup had a good assortment of veggies and the pasta was nicely
risotto was really nice -- flavorful and lightly rich.  the peas were
risotto was perfectly creamy and decadent. i highly recommend tutti mangia for any
insalata casa cuneo is a personal favorite. i tend to gravitate toward the steak, but
orecchiette con pollo - a "little ear" pasta sauted with chicken and a
risotto con gamberi zafferano - arborio rice sauted with large shrimps and mushrooms.
ravioli with red pepper sauce is my favorite thing on the menu.
