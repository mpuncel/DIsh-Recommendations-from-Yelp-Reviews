stuffed shrimp FOODWORD with goat cheese and pesto was basically five warm cocktail shrimp with
rack of lamb FOODWORD (i had it medium-rare) was very good. i had it with the
baked red snapper with mango salsa FOODWORD and chicken pasta diabolo. with the recommendation from the chef and my
skirt steak FOODWORD and it tasted like a microwaved tv dinner. never again!!
spinach and artichoke dip FOODWORD by mistake, it might have been the best one, not something i
ceviche FOODWORD was awesome, and the potato gnocci, to die for. chicken penne pasta
pecan crusted salmon FOODWORD were awesome! great place, but cash only.
stuffed shrimp FOODWORD were very satisfying.
