stuffed shrimp with goat cheese and pesto was basically five
rack of lamb (i had it medium-rare) was very good. i
baked red snapper with mango salsa and chicken pasta diabolo. with the recommendation from
skirt steak and it tasted like a microwaved tv dinner.
spinach and artichoke dip by mistake, it might have been the best
ceviche was awesome, and the potato gnocci, to die
pecan crusted salmon were awesome! great place, but cash only.
