stuffed shrimp with goat cheese and pesto was basically five warm cocktail
rack of lamb (i had it medium-rare) was very good. i had it
baked red snapper with mango salsa and chicken pasta diabolo. with the recommendation from the chef
skirt steak and it tasted like a microwaved tv dinner. never again!!
spinach and artichoke dip by mistake, it might have been the best one, not
ceviche was awesome, and the potato gnocci, to die for. chicken
pecan crusted salmon were awesome! great place, but cash only.
stuffed shrimp were very satisfying.
