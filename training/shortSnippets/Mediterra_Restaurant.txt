calamari - fabulous
calamari was not good. skip it. i ordered the paella. that
paella isn't a dish that chefs should alter but it was
crab cake entree that cost $30.  needless to say, over priced
calamari and bruschetta for appetizers.  i then had the salmon
salmon and we shared tiramisu for desert.  outstanding!!!
octopus appetizer was great and i don't even like octopus in

pork saltimbocca was so-so.
calamari was also pleasing in both taste and sight. i especially
calamari from the nearby witherspoon grill more. the grilled peppers and
paella which was excellent. just the right size portion and perfectly
greek salad made up of too much romaine, one cucumber, less than
