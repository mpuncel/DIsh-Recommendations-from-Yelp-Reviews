polipo - grilled octopus served with marinated onions and potatoes. it's
gnocchi (very light and fluffy-excellent)
caprese salad was two slices of tomatoes with one mozzarella slice
agnolotti - incredible, the braised beef and cheese mix melted in
zuppa di mare (seafood in tomato saffron broth), one had scallops with endive
pappardelle with duck & mushroom ragu... so friggin good!
caprese salad was indeed wonderful.  however, i had the duck
affettati e formaggi (sliced meats and cheeses) - i've never had italian bacon
ossobuco (veal). both were delicious and highly recommended. my boyfriend said
caprese salad and the cured meat and cheese board, both of
funghi salad; i tasted it and it was amazing!  (i'll
penne alla carbonara.  i am a carbonara fan and make
mezzalune are like little pillows heaven. the duck and the suckling
prosciutto was, of course, fantastic, but i was also pleased with
agnolotti (a type of ravioli) was an incredibly rich and savory
cozze e vongole: steamed mussels and clams in a garlic white
risotto frutti di mare was heavenly. the anatra (duck) left me disappointed and craving
anatra (duck) left me disappointed and craving a much cheaper duck
caprese salad (two slices of tomato, but only one piece of
bietole /caprino which is red beets and goat's cheese, arugula, crispy
agnello (roasted elysian fields lamb, tomato, sweet onion and eggplant stew)
spaghetti casalinga  (homemade spaghetti and veal meatballs, crushed tomatoes, garlic, basil).
pesce del giorno.  mom had the risotto and calamari--nice and
caprese salad for appetizer. also highly recommend the suckling pig, sauce
caprese salad i had was yummy and classic.  for dessert
caprese salad.  three slices of ruby red heirloom tomatoes, one
zuppa di mare was so good, i dreamed of a pool filled with
bruschetta was very good, and so was the cheese cake recommended
agnolotti - butter fried sage leaves.  these unbelievably tasty morsels
gnocchi is some of the best i have had
agnolotti and an entree of the penne alla carbonara which were
penne alla carbonara which were both exceptional. i will be dreaming
linguine and lobster and shrimp was excellent as was the veal
prosciutto to garnish.  i found it overly vinegary with little
insalata verde is a bright tasting green salad full of green olives,
gnocchi malfatti is nothing short of spectacular. petite impossibly light dumplings
bistecca alla pizzaiola and were overwhelmed. the fried potatoes and the steak rivaled
cesare barbera with the meal - good and relatively reasonable price-wise.
caprese as a shared app, which was sparing with the very
bruschetta which sounded great but tuns out the tomatoes are smoked
farfalle with lamb with other stuff thrown in.. the homemade farfalle
farfalle was incredible! the flavors however of the dish were mediocre
bruschetta with burrata cheese and port apple puree - it was
bruschetta is supposed to be.  i also tried the sicilian
gnocchi with parmigiano cream
gnocchi was also very soft and delicate and each bite was
pappardelle with duck and mushrooms.  the ossobucco is also outstanding.
pappardelle with rotisserie duck and mushroom ragu. i've never had this
quattro formaggi as the shells were undercooked and the cheese tasted like
risotto frutti di mare which is a seafood pasta. i was much more pleased
lasagna matta which i tasted and it was scrumptious.
risotto frutti di mare which is shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari in a creamy risotto
bruschetta wasn't quite what i was expecting - it was larger
salsiccia with the red peppers "peperonata", and the prosciutto di parma...all
prosciutto di parma...all delicious and fresh. after that, for entrees we
prosciutto to the dish. can't wait to go back! the service,
spaghetti casalinga without the veal meatballs.  so essentially, i ordered spaghetti
linguine to eat as well. excellent tasting, even though i proceeded
agnolotti which were very good and i also had a delmonico
