crab cakes ($5.95) for appetizer - looks really dark on the exterior,
cheesecake isn't the best in the world, but for this price,
chicken marsala and noticed how the mushrooms were drenched in wine previously,
tiramisu cake - layers of delicate combo between cake/chocolate/musse. absolutely delightful!
calamari and the fries were good. i wouldn't go the way
beef lasagna which was pretty cheap, i think it was 6.95? cheap
crab cakes spongy or rock-hard due to poor execution. these were just

penne bolognese is good, but nothing special, which can be said with
gnocchi sausage was not bad, but wasn't anything special. i guess its
tiramisu to be more rich and creamy though.

chicken breast , artichoke hearts, and assorted vegetables like carrots and zucchini
carciofi e pollo was basically a mix of linguini, chicken breast, and vegetables
cheese ravioli was just a double bummer because it was different from
gnocchi sausage and tropicana pizza! niiice
gnocchi sausage has good flavors, but the portion isn't that big. 
chicken parmigiana is decent as well.  i like the tiramisu that
tiramisu that they have.  the service is always friendly and

bruschetta is a personal favorite. let me say, i don't even
chicken parmigiana patty that was microwaved with a piece of cheese on
bruschetta was also soggy by the time they brought it to
marco pollo and it was yummy in my tummy. no joke. i
salmon is a bit small and a bit too much pasta
chicken breast needs some time to be fully and well cooked. 
gnocchi sausage was really good, especially for the price! i got a
bruschetta topping is quite good, but the bread is hard and
calamari appetizer and good salads. ok house wine. generous portions. 
chicken marsala but fetticini was fresh.  pasta bene dish had fresh
bruschetta for only $2!  all of this and the bill
