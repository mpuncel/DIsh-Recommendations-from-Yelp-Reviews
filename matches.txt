A neo-rustic ware-house bistro,  chic in presentation and attitude. The food borders on good to really good. service good to fair. They put real butter in the pasta and they don't skimp on portions. Plan on spending one hundred dollars for two people. Drink some Italian wine to make the experience better. You're sitting on the border of housing projects and Bio-Techs. Hmmm. Outpost?. Almost.



A group of six of us went here on an early Saturday evening and found it to be very enjoyable.  The layout is pretty nice; a cozy little dining room with a small 5- or 6-seat bar as you enter.  There may have been more seating around the back, but I didn't see it.  It would definitely make a good romantic setting, and despite the smallness I didn't feel like other parties were really on top of us.

The food was incredibly well-prepared.  The bean dip they provided with the bread was very savory, my girlfriend's gnocchi might have been the most tender I've ever tasted, and my salmon filet was, no lie, THE most perfectly cooked piece of salmon I've ever had.  It was really unbelievable; cooked just enough, and it flaked apart with an incredible buttery texture.  The only gripe I had was that it wasn't seasoned very strongly, but honestly, when a piece of fish is cooked that perfectly, it creates its own flavor.  The saffron risotto it came with was delicious as well.  The portions are not large, but are enough to keep a regular appetite satisfied.

I would love to come back here during the evening, when the atmosphere of the dining room would certainly be amplified, and based on just the fish I had, I'd be eager to try other dishes.

I've had some good meals here, notably the short rib bolognese over fusilli, but Amelia's does nothing to distinguish itself in my memory.

My bf's coworker took a new hire to lunch here recently but forgot they had a 12:30 meeting back at the office. They had to ask their food to be wrapped as soon as it arrived, and the chef got mad: "This isn't a takeout place!" Your food better be damn near perfect if you're going to be that much of a prima donna, and it ain't.

At dinnertime, I'd spend a few more dollars down the road at Hungry Mother for an overwhelmingly better meal.

Absolutely delicious food. Cute, cozy atmosphere. Service was friendly, prompt and knowledgable. Neighborhood gem - will definitely be back



I was surprised by my boyfriend with a lovely dinner here on Valentine's Day. Luckily he had made a reservation and we were seated right away in this quaint, warm venue that sits on an unassuming corner in Cambridge. 

The seating area was a little cramped, but there's something very charming about a place that can only hold so many people. Our dinner reservation was early and the place was just starting to see the dinner crowd, so my boyfriend and I had a really romantic and relaxing dinner.

Amelia's specializes in polenta and different variations of it (from savory dishes to dessert) and we enjoyed a wonderful polenta dessert with a caramelized brittle and blood orange foam reduction.  It was delicious.  Lamb and lobster for dinner - how could you not? I would definitely recommend Amelia's and look forward to another dinner there!

My girlfriend and I came here for Valentines Day because we wanted a low key and awesomely delicious romantic dinner. Needless to say we got just that. 

We were greeted right away, seated immediately (with a reservation of course), and the service was wonderful. Everyone there was super friendly and courteous.

Food was amazing, lamb, lobster ravioli, antipasto, Polenta. By far some of the best Italian food Ive had in Boston. 

The restaurant is much smaller than expected though so keep that in mind. It is pleasantly located on a quiet street near the Garment district store. Its mostly permit parking only, however there is some metered parking. 

We both had a great time, and can't wait to come back for more.



Had very fun dinner there with my husband. Such a cute little place, perfectly happy with the wines by the glass, service was sweet, food fresh and well prepared. Really liked their take on the whoopie pie, granache over whipped cream!



Good, not great.

Amelia's is close, but the execution is just not what I would expect from their beautiful site, and their relatively high price point. 

The bread should warm (its in the details) and the pasta was a little over cooked, though it was homemade. I can forgive them for running out of the fusilli, and I would be willing to try them again, but for now, disappointed.



My wife and I are visiting from San Francisco.  We happened on were staying at a hotel near by and happened on to this place on our way someplace else..  We got there about 7 and place was very quite which appealed to us.  By the time we left, about 8:30 it was pretty much filled.  Food was exceptional.  Service was great.  We really appreciated the whole experience.  Would definitely recommend it.



LOVE Amelia's . . . my husband and I went there on a busy Friday night and had a wonderful and memorable dinner. I had the seafood special, which was salmon that night, and it was DIVINE. My husband had ravioli.  We each had wine too. They had a wonderful wine list, and thankfully my husband knows wine. We shared a panna cotta dessert with coffee after our meal. 

I didn't like how close the tables were -- we actually got blocked in. And the prices are a bit high, but totally worth it. We will definitely go here for special occasions in the future. :)

BTW I had a voucher from LivingSocial that we used, so that was why we finally tried this great place!

Skip it. 

Limited menu- coupled with items listed on menu but not available. 

Bland food, bland service, bland location and way too high prices....



A little out of the way and a little pricey, but the food was obviously freshly made and they really dressed everything up.  Also a little small but the service was excellent. Overall excellent expereience.



A quiet trattoria that tries hard but misses the mark. 

The lighting is this place kills what could be a cozy, intimate space. Cut down on the halogens before I develop a tan.

Food wise, your traditional Italian fare but executed haphazardly. The calimari came over breaded and tasteless. The antipasto platter had high lights and low lights. 

Tried the homemade spaghetti and they took al dente a little too literal. The sauce was just the right tomato but the doughy pasta strands didn't help. 

Limited wine menu and the carbonara my friend had was nothing to rave about.

Other than location reasons, I would try some place else.

I had a pretty solid experience at Amelia's.

When I booked dinner there for my party of 8, my main priority was getting us out of there so we could hit our evening movie.  What I forgot to bear in mind, however, was the fact that I was booking dinner during the week of Passover, and I tend to observe the holiday rather strictly.  Sooooo, the man upstairs is going to have to pretend that my potato gnocchi didn't have any flour in them, and that if they did, it was potato flour.  That's feasible, right?  At least that's the story I'm tellin'.

Anyhow, though my party took awhile to congregate, our waiter was kind and attentive, I heard good comments about the wine (I opted for tea), and everybody seemed to greatly enjoy their meals.

The salads are GORGEOUS, and the olive plate, too, is like its own salad - delicious.  My potato gnocchi was not at all what I've known gnocchi to be, so I don't know if what I've been eating has been too hard or if Amelia's is too soft, but I think I prefer a firmer gnocchi to Amelia's (one of my friends also got the gnocchi, which she described as "melting in your mouth," where to me it just felt a little mushy, but not too bad).  One way or the other, the flavor was there.  I'd say of both my tea and my dinner that both could have been a little warmer, but I thought despite the not-so-bad temperature issues, the meal was great.

Pricing is a little high, but still reasonable.  Decor is lovely, and if you beat your party there you can always kill some time at the Garment District, which is practically next door!  They were so good about getting us out on time to see our movie, I would definitely go back if I were in the area again.

We went to Amelia's this Saturday night with 3 other couples.  The experience was just what Yelp's three stars represent ... "A-OK".  It was not outstanding but it wasn't horrible either.  The waitress had recommended the braised short rib bolognese very highly, even changed my mind from a previous dish I was contemplating, and while it was good, I expected better than merely good.  There was nothing terribly unique about it, and for a $20 pasta dish, there should be something unique.  The feedback from most of our table was similar ... good meal, but nothing outstanding.  

This was a nice place to try once, but there was nothing compelling that will have us returning any time soon.

Disgusting!  

I wish I could give this zero stars.

I've been aching to go to Amelia's for a while now, just hitting up another spot I haven't been to, and wow, the satisfaction of my curiosity was not worth this.

It was like a list of what not to do when you open a restaurant.

The waiter kept talking to random people that would walk in to chat with him and then mozy away.

All of the food was under-salted, over-greased, and plated atrociously.

The mussels were old, I could immediately tell after biting into one because it tasted like soggy old boot.

The crab cakes where all bread and no crab.

And everything was waaaayyy to expensive for the crap they were shilling.

Skip it, skip it, skip it.  The only thing good about the place was the waiter deducting the food from our bill because we refused to eat it.  Gross!!!

We went during Restaurant Week, which gave us a nice sampling of their menu, and the night we went, they'd added several options to the advertised Restaurant Week menu.

The phrase that comes to mind when I think of our experience at Amelia's is "except for..."

The atmosphere is sweet -- intimate tables, view of the kitchen, rustic brick walls...except for the flat screen t.v. at the bar that makes it seem like they might have aspired to be a sports bar once.

The food is decent -- the descriptions on the menu sound delicious and decadent...except that each dish we tried had its own downfall. 
The tomato tart was pretty...except that it was a bit bland and difficult to eat. 
The goat cheese/broccoli rabe ravioli had a rich sauce and delicious sausage...except that the filling was way too salty. 
The braised short rib bolognese had tender meat and uniquely-shaped pasta...except that it had little flavor and needed a stronger sauce to complement the meat. 
The panna cotta was beautifully presented...except that it was bland, and there wasn't enough fruit and sauce to balance the custard. 

The one area where I can give unequivocal compliments is the service. The waitstaff were all pleasant, we knew who our waitress was, but we were served by every staff member at least once. Whoever was available made sure our needs were met, our food and drinks were delivered, or our plates were removed.

Amelia's Trattoria has a lot of potential. It doesn't make sense for them to try to compete with more traditional Italian restaurants. The ideas for the dishes described on the menu sound outstanding, but execution falls short. If I didn't know from their website that they've been around for twelve years, I would think they have some growing up to do.

Great spot for a good, quick and affordable lunch if you work in the area.  Just get to Amelia's before noon though because it gets very crowded.



We went on a Friday night around 7pm and got a table right away without a reservation. After briefly considering CBC but rejecting it because it was zOMGs loud and crowded, it was delightful to walk into relative quiet and intimacy of Amelia's. The crowd was definitely different--mostly older couples and small groups, rather than the youngish yuppie biotech mass-exodus swarm at other places in Kendall. One semi-complaint: why the TV? ESPN kind of ruins the ambience of this otherwise quite nice space. Is that necessary for a Friday night dinner hour? As for food, we had the arancini appetizer, which was delicious, and the arugula salad and the ravioli special. All of the food was wonderful, and served in reasonable (read: not ginormous) portions. The prices were about on par with any other nice dinner we might have gotten in the area. I would certainly go again, and recommend it to others.

The food outkicks the coverage at Amelia's.  It's nice that it has only a limited number of tables, and you can call the place quaint.  But really its the menu that looks simple, and is, that delivers the goods.

I guess i'm knocking off a few stars because the wine list was unimpressive and the vibe felt painted on the walls.  Our service was good.  I just can't think of why I would want to come back - its across the street from a parking garage.  If this place were a few blocks over on Mass it would benefit from more pleasing surroundings.



I definitely liked Amelia's but I for sure prefer a number of the other neighborhood restaurants.  The restaurant appears to love olive oil...I was disappointed by my panini because it was pretty well drenched with olive oil and found the straight olive oil as dipping sauce a bit strange.  I dipped my bread in the oil and found it didn't taste that good.  I requested and received balsamic vinegar...that helped but I simply remained not that impressed.  After reading other reviews, it appears that other things on the menu would be worth trying but I gave it a shot and it didn't land on my favorites list.



Nice unique looking bar (magnetic apparently) with a warm atmosphere and very friendly staff. We had Zoe as our waitress and she was pleasant and attentive. Had the shortrib pasta which was delicious though probably enough for two. Look forward to going there again and trying the rest of their menu.



I went to amelia's for new years this year and it was great.  6 courses, i had a confit duck that was amazing, black truffle pasta, tuna tartar, it was unreal.  My date had the beef tenderloin and lobster tail and was beside herself. The creme brulee was delicious as well.

Service was great, food was great, definitely going here for new years again next year.

It was a bit crowded, so I took a seat outside. The servers were humorous and nice. The food was okay.



I have never left a food review online before but my experience at Amelia's needed to be recognized.

The food selection at Amelia's is both elegant and diverse.  The Short Ribs Bolognese melts in your mouth and the homemade pasta was cooked perfectly.  I am not a huge pasta person, but I could have eaten two orders of this entree.

Overall, the food was exceptional, from top to bottom, one of the best meals I've had in Boston.  As impressed with the meal as I was, the food quality was overshadowed by the service.

My server, Jeff, was not only attentive and knowledgeable, but he was very quick witted and funny.  He was the perfect compliment to a great meal.  He said he works Monday nights, so I highly recommend Amelia's as an end to the worst day of the week.    

You can experience great food at many restaurants in Boston, but come to Amelia's if you want to experience greatness in a restaurant!



We went to this restaurant for my boyfriend's birthday after seeing them reviewed on the Phantom Gourmet.  The service was good, they were attentive but I was very underwhelmed by the food and overwhelmed by our bill.  We had two glasses of wine, I had an appetizer salad and mussels while my boyfriend had the lobster ravioli.  It came to $80.  The lobster ravioli was $33 for five smaller sized ravioli.  The salad was fine, I had asked for the dressing on the side however it came dressed.  The mussels were an okay portion but did not come w/any bread or anything to soak in the sauce.  My boyfriend said the ravioli were good but he ate them in about 3 minutes and since there weren't too many on his plate, he was done eating.
This was not a great dining experience for us.

Please please do not go there if you are on your lunch break unless you wanna get fired. We waited an hour to get our food. Once we got the food, there was at least three incorrect orders. No bread was offered while we were waiting. The servers have absolutely no sense of customer service. This is the most horrible Italian place i have been in States.



Excellent Italian outside of the North End. No better place to eat in Kendall before a movie.



I visited Amelia's for the first time last week with my son who is  very hard to please when it comes to eating out.   We were impressed that the owner Delio Susi, is also the chef and was in the kitchen doing most of the cooking.   I ordered the rack of lamb and it may have been the best that I have ever had.   Seasoned and cooked to perfection it just about melted in my mouth.  My son had raviolis with a beef gravy and he enjoyed it as well.   The restaurant although rather small had two large groups that were seated ahead of us and I thought we may have a problem waiting for our meals.  Not a problem at all.  As the food got cooked it was served as fast as it came off of the stoves.   The only people working there that evening were the bartender and waitress and they did a very good job handling the crowd.   The bartender did tell us that the chef would cook meals that were not on the menu if he could by request and that the menus usually changed with the seasons.  The only sour spot in the evening was the $30.00 ticket on my car when we left.  I had thought the meter maids only worked at night in East Cambridge  near the Court House.  I was wrong and I will not make that mistake again.  Make sure that you park in a legal space and you will have an enjoyable night of fine dining.

Good, local restaurant.  They make a surprisingly nice Arabbiatta--the service, however, is painfully slow.  Still, a good place to catch lunch with friends--definetly make reservations.



My husband and I went here one night after seeing a movie at the Kendall.  The food was wonderful.  I had the linguine with clams in a red sauce.  The sauce was like a broth and it was so flavorful.  My husband had the hanger steak and fries.  The steak was cooked to the right temp and was very tender.  For dessert we had the tiramisu (one of the best I have ever had!) and an olive oil and lemon panna cotta (delicious!).  The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food.  

My only gripe about the place is the space.  The restaurant is small, which is fine except for the fact that they have put too many tables into the dining room.  My husband is tall and built like a line backer, so he had to really squeeze into his seat.  I had to have the people at the table behind us push a chair to the side so I could slide into my seat.  I noticed a lot of other diners precariously getting in and out of their chairs and trying not to bump into people and tables as they made their way through the restaurant.  Having a little extra wiggle room would have made the place much more comfortable.

Ate here during Winter Restaurant week 2010. This was my first time at the restaurant. Overall I think the menu was somewhat dissapointing. I should have realized that nothing on the appetizer menu really appealed to me. I ended up having the stewed clams which were fine nothing special. My guests had the fried potato ball (she liked it, I didn't care for the smokey cheese inside), other guest had the mushroom tart which was good but  all it entailed was premade puff pasty, sauteed mushrooms and some greens on top. For entrees I had gnocchi with sausage bolognese. It was very tasty though not much meat in the sauce. My guests had papparadelle w/ pesto which was good, and the other had salmon and requested salad and vegetables in place of risotto. I didn't try the salmon but it looked average. Came with salad but no side of brocolli rabe as promised.

The the thing that really pissed me off was the dessert. A 'pear popover' was really pre made puffed pastry baked with sauteed pear inside. I'm sorry this is not a popover. The panna cotta was also pretty pathetic. It's as if the kitchen was screaming- WE DONT' HAVE A PASTRY CHEF! If you don't have one as they clearly don't- then try to provide something you can actually execute professionally. Get some nice sorbets or learn a few easy italian cookie recipes. The dessert was really junk.

Overall a nice place to have dinner though cramped. Good drinks. Enjoy the pasta but don't get any dessert!

I had lunch here once, but found the meal (a chicken panini I think) very bland and haven't returned since.  Some co-workers complained of under cooked chicken in one of their sandwiches on a recent vist.  The Teele Sq location is definitely better than this one.

Ambience was nice - definitely a cute idea for a restaurant.  However, I was disappointed with a certain female server on staff (she kept forgetting to bring back the food she had packaged, and even forgot one of our meals).  The food was decent, but not overly exciting, so for that reason we felt that it was overpriced.  Had a good time with friends but definitely not rushing back to eat there any time soon...



My boyfriend and I came here on a Wednesday evening.  Even for the middle of the week, almost every table was filled.  Without a reservation, we were able to grab a place at the bar. (Tip: make a reservation before coming here!)

Atmosphere:  We liked the warmth and intimate feel of the restaurant.  The bar was large, so it didn't feel crowded.  The bar is not ideal for tall people - there is not much room under the table to fit your legs!  My boyfriend had to sit sideways the whole night.

Food: The food was tasty, but nothing really special. The salads were fresh and big (note that the beet salad is only beets, apples, and pecans, no greens like I'd expected).  The ravioli of the day, a mushroom ravioli with a pork sauce was tasty but a little rich for our tastes.  The cioppino had tons of fish and the tomato sauce was flavorful.  

Service:  The waitstaff and bartender were very pleasant and attentive.

Overall a decent Italian dinner, but we won't rush to go back.

driving in the middle of the rain trying to find a parking spot

on the radio, the hostess in her funny bostonian accent was babbling about a guy who strangled his wife 10 years ago and dumped the body in a shopping cart, who served in an all-male MA jail, who now wants to have a transgender surgery ....blah. blah, all his bra, panties, shaving brazers, his SRS would ALL be paid by TAX dollars, his hormone therapy, his electorosis; he was allowed to shave 2 a day

amelia's trattoria was such a nice shelter in the middle of a downpour and all these CHAOS

Rioja's wine was great, as always, the P.E.I mussels were superb, absolutely clean and fresh, with the right taste, I drunk a lot of the soup  :-)
the pappardelle with wild mushroom was awesome too

what a night, thank god you can enjoy some good food, even in a Demo/donkey state :-)

I walked to the open kitchen and said to the chef "molte grazie" wholeheartedly

Started going here last year when we were living in Kendall. Had a huge snow storm and walked down to eat. Loved it ever since. 

One of my favorite places! Love the menu and the staff. Anyone who remembers you when you come back gets an A+++ in my book. 

Walked in last night without a reservation (decided last minute that cooking at home for Valentines Day was alot more work than we wanted)

Sat right down and had a fantastic dinner. Our waiter remembered us and treated us like royalty. Not too expensive and always tasty!

Great place for dinner after work.



Went here on a Thursday night with a party of five.  We could only get a reservation at 6 (we wanted 6:30), but when we showed up, there was one other party of four there.  Not sure why 6:30 wasn't possible.  Seated immediately.  Decor is attractive for this small place.  Service was good, but the food was bland.  Meatball appetizer was generous (four small meatballs), but I couldn't find any flavor to them.  I had the fish of the day, which was crusted salmon with lemon risotto.  I can't remember a worse risotto than the one I had there.  As for the salmon, it was totally lacking flavor and the crust did nothing for the flavor.  The one saving grace was the apple tart with vanilla ice cream for dessert, which was outstanding.

By the time we left, only one other table was filled, so being unable to get a 6:30 reservation made even less sense.

When I go to dinner however, I need more than a great dessert.  The food (except for the risotto) wasn't terrible, but if I'm paying $25 for the fish of the day, there HAS to be more to say about it than "it was okay."  

Attractive decor, attentive staff, but the food is not great.  There are much better places in Cambridge to have dinner, most definitely.

Came here with a group of friends, during Boston Restaurant Week. It's a small place with view of the kitchen, and a nice atmosphere. Food wise, I was underwhelmed.

Pork sausage with polenta and asparagus- did not particularly like any component by itself, but when combined together at every bite was pretty good. Sausage was a bit spicy, which I appreciated.

Steak with wedge fries- steak was a bit burnt on the outside. The sauce, which was very tasty, covered this up for the most part, and also added moisture to the beef, which was otherwise lacking. I really wanted to like the fries, but they were completely tasteless and there wad no salt on the table.

Pear turnover with hazelnut icecream and blackberry coulis- turnover  was very good and flavorful. The icecream was good by itself, but I could not taste it when mixed with turnover-- strange pairing. Could not taste the tiny pool of coulis at all, which I found very odd.

After dinner, I asked for a cappuccino, which came flavored with cinnamon. Not my cup of tea, and would have been nice if the server mentioned it beforehand. Other than that, service was good and friendly, and our water glasses were never empty. 

Overall the experience was alright, but nothing special- next time I will probably try another place instead. Glad I had a chance to test it during restaurant week rather than at full price.

I LOVE this place. Service is excellent!! I'm vegetarian and love food, so it's always great to find restaurants that will tweak their recipe to make it veggie!! Considering that everything is made from scratch (unlike a LOT of restaurants), they can accommodate pretty much any request. It's a little pricey but totally worth it for that special occasion!!



Note that you should always call for a reservation here at Amelia's.  We came on a Wednesday night without a reservation and were surprised that our only option was to sit at the bar or at a table next to the windy entrance.  We opted for the bar.  The bar was a bit awkward to sit at -- there is very little leg room so I had to sit with my legs turned sideways toward my date.  Could have been awkward if she hadn't been my long time girlfriend!

Atmosphere was really nice here.  So nice, in fact, that I wanted to like the food more than I actually did.  It has a warm, cozy feel in the winter.  It is also fairly small.  And it appears that in the summer the windows open up for a nice open air feel.

 I had the spinach salad which was very good.  Portions for the salad were very large, too.  We could have split one for the two of us.  I then had the ravioli of the night. -- with mushrooms and truffle oil and in a red sauce with pork sausage.  It was decent, but not as good as I was hoping.  Portion size was perfect though -- and prices seemed reasonable here.  I may have to come back to try something else.

I went to Amelia's on a recent Wednesday evening with a couple of co-workers.  We were all traveling from out of town and in search of a good meal at the end of a long day.  Amelia's was satisfying.  Following our server's suggestion, we ordered a bottle of Sangiovese which was quite good, and reasonably priced by restaurant menu standards.  We each ordered a salad and entree and all found our food to be quite good.  The total bill for the three of us was $150 plus tip.  The service was very good, and the atmosphere was cozy and warm.  

All in all a good experience.  Definitely worth trying out.



I met two friends of mine at Amelia -- butter, and slow service.

Let's talk about the second one first.  I show up for my meal -- granted, I was 10 minutes late -- and they told me that they had a table and they were just setting it up for me.  There were three empty tables at the time -- one of which was our table to be.  It was over 15 minutes before we sat down, though.  Does setting the table really take 15 minutes?!

Also, service was uncoordinated.  Two people came by to greet us, five minutes apart from each other -- and it's awkward when you tell a server: "I've already been helped."  Because really, if I"m still standing there -- I haven't *really* been helped yet.

And when we sat down, two separate waiters came by to try to take our order.  And the same thing with the bill!  Say what?!  There was also a long delay between sitting down, having our orders taken, getting the appetizer, and getting the entree.  I suspect this may be because of understaffing issues =/


The food is pretty tasty -- the flavours are even above average!  We ordered the polenta with mushrooms as the appetizer -- it was softer than I was used to (butter!) but it melded and molded well with the mushrooms and the cheese on top.  Definitely recommend this!

My gnocchi with butternut squash was also quite good -- the gnocchi was again very soft (butter!) but seasoned very well, and the squash provided a great counter-sweetness to the dish.  But it was absolutely DRENCHED WITH BUTTER.  At the end, when it had cooled down slightly and all that was left was melted butter, I just kept thinking about my arteries.

You should walk home.  And then go for a run.
And maybe limit your visits to Amelia's to like once a month.  I don't like my friends that much.

i really like amelia's... it's very small and cozy and the food is really good. i've been there 2 or 3 times and i love their fried calimari (it's very light... you don't feel like you ate a lead brick afterward). the service can be a little slow, but it's a nice place to go if you're willing to sit back and relax. reservations might be necessary some nights, but i've just called ahead to see how busy they are when i've gone.



Calamari appetizer was too rich with soggy texture.  But, the worst was the linguini with white clam sauce, which was far too spicy.  Not edible, and I'm usually just fine with spice.  My husband's pappardelle was good, however.



i work just around the block, so every time i feel like having a "special" lunch my co-workers and I head to Amelia's. This place is very cozy and the staff very friendly. I usually choose between the most perfect italian panini, the soup of the day or one of their salads. Although they use tasty fresh ingredients, the food is nothing to die for, so don't keep your hopes up. Yet, for the reasonable prices, this is a place I would recommend.



After a miserable experience on Saturday night in the North End, I returned to my roots at Amelias Trattoria.  Absolutely the best Italian food and experience.  The calamari is killer and the caesar salad is so full of flavor!
Once again, Amelias was awesome!

I was taken here on a weekday evening, and it wasn't too crowded.

I thought the food was great for a not-too-expensive but still nice restaurant. The portions were a bit small, but not excessively so (and really, they were 'normal' people portions, not restaurant portions). I tried the calamari with lemon risotto, which I really liked, and the mushroom risotto, which I mostly liked. (I say mostly because it tasted great, but they included this one kind of soft mushroom that reminded me of slugs for some reason. First type of mushroom I've encountered that I didn't love, ick).

In terms of the ambiance, it was great. The restaurant was dimly lit but not to the point where you'd get eyestrain, and pretty quiet, overall. The waiter that we had (who I think was also the host?) came by every 10 mins or so to refill our water, so we didn't have any service problems.



Amelia's is probably my favorite Italian place in Boston and I was so happy to see all the other positive reviews for this place. 
I am a garlic bread fiend and this place serves up some of the tastiest. My boyfriend could live off of their veal parmigiana.

I don't know what Amelia's Trattoria's stance is on sustainable environmental practices, but I'm urging all of my favorite restaurants to look into becoming certified green restaurants, i know that the green restaurant association works pretty closely with restaurants who want to become more sustainable. 

Just an idea =)
It will be a perfect day when restaurants as delicious as Amelia's are also certified green.



Solid meal, not fantastic, but definitely edible.  Great location for dinner and a movie with Kendall Square Cinema.  Salmon special with risotto was delicious but parpadellle with mushrooms was skippable. Great salad with goat cheese and pancetta (best part of the meal).  Limited wine list.  A nice quiet find in a corner of Cambridge for a romantic evening.  But not necessarily because of the food.

There are a few things you should know about me & Amelia.  

1. I live around the block.
2. I usually go for a late lunch/early supper when no one else is there.
3. With the exception of one time, I always go by myself.

The food is fantastic, I used to only get the mushroom ravioli, but have branched out and tried short rib, risotto, gnocchi, etc.  It is all tasty, the staff and chef are a fun bunch of guys that really care about the quality of food you're getting.  

I see this place get busy at night for dinner which makes me happy.  It's a small dining area, but feels cozy not squashed.  During the holidays they had a pumpkin creme brulee for dessert that was So Good.  It's a bit more than I normally want to spend on lunch, but I feel so comfortable eating alone in here, being able to relax, take my time, that I totally treat myself to some fine dining in the afternoon especially if I have to go in to work later that night.

Yum, yum.



Came back again for lunch during the summer (despite my own advice) and once again was uncomfortably warm.

But, I also returned recently on a cooler autumn evening and was pleasantly surprised by a very delicious meal of lobster ravioli (with large pieces of lobster both inside the ravioli and topping it) and gnocchi with butternut squash and sage.  Both dishes were beautifully executed and plated and were definitely a notch up from the lunch offerings.

I was a bit disappointed with the kitchen noise level (very loud conversations going on and it's an open kitchen!) but I'm going to chalk that up to us being the first and only table at 5 PM (we missed lunch that day :) ).

This was a nice random find on a trip to Boston.  The place is small and cozy and the noise level is just right.  The antipasto platter contained a nice selection of meats and a fantastic tangy goat cheese.  The Caesar salad here is nice if like bits of anchovy.  The foccacia bread they serve is top notch.  I had a the braised short rib bolognese which was a much bigger portion than I imagined it would be.  The only issue is that they don't really salt the entrees.  Salt aside, the experience was a nice one.

amelia's trattoria is a hidden gem, right in my neighborhood.  when my boyfriend and i decided to come here last night with a livingsocial.com coupon in hand, we couldn't understand why we didn't come here more often.  well, it's a bit pricey, which prevents us from frequenting more.  however, the food is well-done gourmet italian fare, a cuisine which has been attempted so many times around town, sometimes to little success.  however, amelia's quality is on par.  

i had made reservations for 9.30pm but we were late [yes, it was a very late dinner].  our server greeted us in the small, cozy, warm interiors, and joked that we needed to leave because we were late.  he sat us next to another couple having dinner.  however, another server was setting up the table next to the windows, and said that we could have that table once he was done setting it up.  i was delighted at the better table, where we could have a little privacy as well from the couple.  they brought us bread with this yummy white bean paste spread.  the cumin in the bean paste made it appear reddish, and it had rosemary and olive oil sprinkled all over it.  very delicious, but i'm a fan of bean paste spreads.

we started off with the antipasto dish for two.  it consisted of proscuitto, salami and another slice of meat as a bedding for gherkins, goat cheese, provolone cheese, artichoke hearts and an abundance of roasted red peppers.  very good, but i guess i was hoping for more of a charcuterie plate.  however, wrong cuisine, that's french.  dammit.

we also ordered the braised short rib bolognese with fusili.  it was a little more on the sweet side than savory but so creamy and decadent!  it was hot out, so we weren't able to finish this very rich dish, even though the portion size [shared between two people] was just perfect.  so we decided to brown bag it, which the server was surprised about but gladly obliged, and offered to pack it with more bread and white bean spread to accompany us home with.  our bill ended up being under the coupon we came with, so we tipped based upon their fantastic service!

We were excited to finally get a chance to visit this cute little Italian restaurant in Cambridge. We had heard great things about this restaurant and were excited when we saw what looked like a really interesting menu. But what we found was that the food was mediocre, and way too pricy for what you get. I got the pasta dish with mussels in it (forget the name), but the mussels lacked flavor. In fact, the entire dish lacked flavor. It looked cool because it was served in a pan, but the sauce itself was so watery it left the noodles without any sauce to go with it. The meatballs were so-so. I'd say the best part of the meal was the free bread and hummus that came with it. The hummus was actually really good.

Word to the wise - if you're coming here for lunch, come early and don't come in a big group. Oh, and don't expect excellent service either. But do come, because the food is really good. 

The food is fresh and the ingredients are good quality. They certainly don't skimp here and the prices are fair. There's everything from paninis to hearty pasta dishes to soups and salads. I happened to have the spinach salad with caramelized shallots, pancetta and goat cheese. YUM!

The tables are very close together and jam packed into this tiny little place. There were also only two waiters serving the entire place, so I can understand why they seemed so stressed out. 

Overall, I'll be back. You should try it too, just don't get too fussy about the service. They mean well. And the bread/olive oil is sooo good.

Has Amelia's lost its way?

I think so. After years of enjoying family celebratory meals, there's just not much going for Amelia's. We had the ravioli and gnocci, both with identical, non-descript sauce. A decent bottle of chianti for thirty bucks, and so-so service. With all the great bread going around Cambridge these days the bread basket here was sparse and bland. 

Good artichoke salads which seem to have taken the wonderful vegetable in its prime. But maybe they're out of a can. I don't know. One thing I do know would improve things. LOSE the sports TV. Are you a sports bar or an upscale dining place? 

Please, bring back the quality, serenity, and service of the old Amelia's!

Amelia's for dinner was unbelievable. Talk about being classy without being pretentious. This place is on the top of my list. The downside of the place as already noted is that it's just west of Kendall Square and there isn't much for a view. However, it's fantastic for an intimate atmosphere and fabulous food. Intimate is the key word. The place is tiny and a crowd would probably ruin the experience, but excellent for a first date. 

My favorite things about this place:
1) Half bottles of wine - perfect for two
2) Fresh pasta
3) White Truffle Oil
4) Windows that open onto the street (for the summer)
5) Reasonable prices (entrees run from $15-$25) 

My husband's comments is that this place has all the good food of the North End without the rude service and tourists. Amelia's is highly recommended for you next date!



I was in town for a conference and arrived a day early.  I looked on Yelp for a place to eat and came across Amelia's Trattoria since it was within walking distance of the Boston Marriott in Cambridge.  For a Monday evening, I was the first patron (albeit was 6:30pm).  But that meant I was 1 of 2 people who could order the braised short rib bolognese with fusili pasta ($20).  The fusili itself was fantastically made - just the right consistency and texture, and great at holding the bolognese sauce.  I very much enjoyed it and had it with a glass of red wine ($7, can't recall which one).

Prior to the main showing up, I had a mixed greens salad ($7) which was quite large.  It could have used more salt (strangely, no salt/pepper shakers on the table), but overall, it was good.

With tax and tip, the total came out to $43.  Service was very attentive, though perhaps it was because I was one of the few patrons in the place.  I would come here again.

Good food ! Make reservations for sure



Phantom gourmet recommended this place.  They deserve every star possible. Highest quality food. Everything down to the pasta is fresh daily. Extremely reasonably priced. Average entree price between $18-$22. Worth the drive where ever you are from. Superb. Better than any place in North End. If your from Boston- i DARE u to prove me wrong!



I enjoyed the atmosphere until a group of 'kids' came it and ruined the ambiance. Other than that the dining room was cozy and charming, the staff was polite and helpful, and the food was good. I loved my short rib bolognese over fusilli and the Arancini was delicious. The preserved lemon risotto was cooked perfectly, however the white and green onion really overpowered the dish.

This place isn't half bad. Nor is it anything in particular to write home about. The service is so god damn slow though, which is my biggest gripe. I mean seriously, especially during the lunch HOUR why the fuck are the waiters so slow? It puzzles me and makes no sense to me (idk maybe they're all baked), but it has resulted in me calling them more often than not to place pick up orders rather than eat at the restaurant. 

The food itself is actually quite tasty and I think the portions are very satisfying for the $10-15 pricetag. I would probably go more often if the service was better (the people who work there are all actually very nice, just SO slow...please read this and hurry the fuck up next time. I'm not a CEO who can take 3 hour lunch breaks, I'm a much lower rung on the corporate ladder who likes good food in a timely fashion).



Amelia's Trattoria, I ask you this: "How am I ever supposed to become a vegetarian if you don't stop making brilliant plates of meat?!" In Light on Yoga, Iyengar states that you cannot be a yogi if you eat meat, not possible, making my quest in life a little problematic, especially considering the menu awaiting me every time I happen into this place. I will resist one day, enter into a state of samadhi, and never eat here again. Until then...What a hidden gem!

So, obviously, what I personally think that they do really well is  meat. I was not so crazy about the spaghetti when I had it, but the meat plates are exquisite, the sauces are always delicious and very well balanced. The quality of the meat is consistently excellent, and they really know just how to cook it - don't bother giving a preference because at this place, the chef knows best - let him do his job, and you won't regret it.

The pork with cherry demi glace - such a dark earthy sauce and the meat so juicy! They also have done a short ribs plate that was really superbly done, melts in the mouth. As a future vegetarian, I say come here for the meat. The wine is also nice. I have never been disappointed.

EDIT - about the vegetarian options - the butternut squash gnocchi with crispy sage!  !  ! And I am ashamed to say the steak is so tender and juicy and the sauce is interesting and well balanced oh god. Oh, and I'm not supposed to drink wine either but you are fool who does not order the Marina Svetic (sp?) Montepulciano D'Abruzzo

Very dissapointing. My boyfriend's salmon was somehow both burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. It also did not have any real flavor or seasoning to district your taste buds from the repulsive texture. 

We were planning on doing dinner and a movie at the Kendall, but went straight home after this place left a bad taste in our mouths!

This restaurant is wonderful! Quaint and cozy. The staff is very engaging and the chef's specials are always a delight! The variety offered on the menu is very creative and I have yet to be disappointed! Always recommend the ravioli of the night! Fantastic!!!!

My boyfriend decidede to try Amelia's for restaurant week since everyone is always telling us how good it is. We went late around 9:30 on a Tuesday so the service experience was great. The food was simple but still good and the presentation was nice. For appetizers we had the spinach salad with goat cheese & vinegrette and the fried calamari. For dinner I had the salmon dish which both my boyfriend and I enjoyed. My boyfriend had the hanger steak with fries which was ok. For dessert we both enjoyed the Wild Berry Panna Cotta which is kind of like a flan texture with fruit. All in all we had a pretty good experience. We would definately go back again.

The entrance is a bit odd, hard to tell if you're just supposed to wait by the door or walk past the bar and go to the nearest computer where staff may be.  Other than that momentary confusion, we were seated promptly.

Man friend and I started off with a Calamari appetizer.
It came out with more rice than calamari, which was a surprise, as there is no mention of it in the menu.  The rice was a little strange so that didn't go over so well with us.

We shared two pastas.
A bolognese and clams in white sauce.  
Both were very flavorful and very yummy!

Service was pretty good aside from running out of water.

I'd say this place is a 3.5 because of the Calamari, but would rather round up than down.



Location, location, location.

Amelia's is at the corner of Harvard and Portland, jammed in between housing projects at the eastern edge of Central Sq. and the sterile, highrise offices at the western edge of Kendall Sq.  I'm still not certain how I found my way into Amelia's, but I'm pretty sure I had to get lost on the set of 'A Clockwork Orange' to get there.

Dropped, as if by chance, into this bleak and awkward location, and with few good parking options and about a mile away from the nearest T stop, Amelia's defiies the odds by surviving, year after year, even as restaurants closer to Kendall and Central come and go.

So why does Amelia's persist while better-situated peers perish?  To borrow from a former, philandering President: Its the food, dummy.  Amelia's offers a delectable range of pastas, seafood, meat dishes, and vegetarian options, all of which are reasonably priced and are served in generous portions.  The waitstaff are also knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt.  The wine list, although not huge, is diverse and also reasonably priced.  Desserts are quite good too, although after an appetizer and meal, you'll probably want to ride home in a wheel barrow and forego further stomach expansion.

Critics claim that Amelia's is dark - its true, the exposed brick walls, dark woods, and heavy red drapes glow brilliantly on a sunny day, but add lots of *atmospere* at night.  

I'm a fan, but I understand why my friends have never heard of it and are unwilling to venture into this peculiar corner fo the city.  But for those willing to park near a dodgy part of town or walk a mile for their dinner, then Ameila's will pleasantly suprise you and still not leave you poor.



The food at this comfortable, friendly little place was basically good, but with a few mis-steps.  The polenta with wild mushrooms appetizer was very tasty, but the mushrooms were dry.  The description says "wild mushroom braise" but they were devoid of moisture.  The flavor was great, but the texture was somewhat unpleasant.  The polenta, itself, was wonderful, so it was disappointing that the mushrooms didn't measure up.  Likewise, the calimari  in the "crispy calimari" appetizer was delicious, but the so-called risotto was absolutely awful!  It had the taste and texture of undercooked "converted" (i.e. precooked and dried) rice.  This light and tasty calimari would have been better served with a little salad.  And the rice would be better served by a trip to the garbage...

Other dishes around the table were excellent.  An eggplant appetizer was wonderful and their plain spaghetti with a light marinara sauce was very good, as well.  

I really enjoyed the atmosphere and parts of this dinner.  We'd be willing to try it again, but hope they read diner reviews.  I've seen that risotto panned in a number of reviews and am surprised they don't take these things to heart.
